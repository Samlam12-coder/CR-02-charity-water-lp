# AI Prompts to Kickstart Your Charity: Water Landing Page

## Basic Page Structure

Create a simple HTML layout for a nonprofit landing page with sections for a hero, a story, and a call-to-action.

## Style with Brand Identity
Write CSS using a color palette of yellow (#FFC907) for all headings and buttons, and fonts that feel bold and modern.

## Build the Hero Section
Create a hero section with a centered headline, subheadline, and full-width background image that grabs attention.

Add a section for a real-world impact story with text and an image, and a donation section with a bold yellow 'Help Someone Thrive Today' button.

## Add Story + CTA Sections

## Make It Responsive
Add CSS media queries so this landing page looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. Add code comments to help explain why we use media queries.
